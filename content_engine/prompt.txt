You are generating a JSON lesson payload (one lesson). Return ONLY valid JSON (no explanations, no Markdown, no code fences). Use this exact JSON structure:

{
  "lesson_id": 101,
  "title": "Lesson 1.1: Greetings",
  "desc": "Formal vs informal greetings",
  "module_id": 1,
  "order_index": 0,
  "content": [...]
}

Requirements for the content list:
- Split the lesson into sub-lessons (2+). You may choose how many based on the theme.
- Each sub-lesson must end with a quiz.
- The final item must be a summary quiz that reviews ALL blocks in the lesson (words + theory + any extra notes).
- Quiz options and correct_answer must use only words from this lesson.
- Include at least 2 vocab_card items and exactly 1 visual_decoder for the full lesson.
- Keep blocks logically grouped by theme.
- Add a cultural or usage note inside one theory block (field: culture_note).
- If the lesson includes "yes/no" or polite replies, include both male and female variants.
- For sub-lessons, add a sublesson_title field in the opening theory block.
- All text must be in English (except Khmer words themselves).

Item formats:
- theory: {title, text, culture_note?, sublesson_title?}
- vocab_card: {front, back, pronunciation, audio}
- visual_decoder: {word, target_char, hint, english_translation, letter_series, word_audio, char_audio_map}
- quiz: {question, options, correct_answer, explanation?}

CRITICAL AUDIO RULES:
1. For vocab_card: "audio" field must be EMPTY STRING "" (audio will be auto-generated)
2. For visual_decoder:
   - "word_audio" must be EMPTY STRING ""
   - "char_audio_map" must be EMPTY OBJECT {} (no char mappings)
3. Do NOT include any file paths or extensions in audio fields
4. The system will automatically generate audio files based on the Khmer text

Example vocab_card:
{
  "type": "vocab_card",
  "data": {
    "front": "Hello (formal)",
    "back": "ជំរាបសួរ",
    "pronunciation": "jom-reep-suor",
    "audio": ""
  }
}

Example visual_decoder:
{
  "type": "visual_decoder",
  "data": {
    "word": "អរគុណ",
    "target_char": "ណ",
    "hint": "Find «ណ» at the end: អ-រ-គុ-ណ. It is the final character in the word.",
    "english_translation": "Thank you",
    "letter_series": 1,
    "word_audio": "",
    "char_audio_map": {}
  }
}
